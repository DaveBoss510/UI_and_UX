# Dave's UI_and_UX Projects
 UI and UX designer course at the Tech Academy

 -["Elegant and Joyful" Cat Website Project with JS Button feature](https://github.com/DaveBoss510/UI_and_UX/blob/main/Cat_Website/eligant_cat_website_project.html)<br>
 This website project I was instructed to use a color palette that helped induce joy, with elegant text. I also needed 
 to incorportate a Javascript Button feature. 

-[Fluid Bootstrap Layout](https://github.com/DaveBoss510/UI_and_UX/blob/main/bootstrap%20project/responsivebootstrap.html)<br>
This website showcases my ability to create a multiple column container website with a fluid 
layout design. This gives the ability to change the layout structure with different viewport size (screen size), keeping
an organized layout for users with different devices and varying screen sizes. 

-[Responsive Bootstrap Layout](https://github.com/DaveBoss510/UI_and_UX/blob/main/bootstrap%20project/responsivebootstrap.html)
<br>
This website is another example of a layout that reacts to screen size via a responsive layout design. I determined the
 the breakpoint for the user's device's viewport (pixel size) and instructed how the layout is organized in a specific way based
 on different screen sizes.
