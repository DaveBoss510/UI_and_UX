-[Fluid Bootstrap Layout](https://github.com/DaveBoss510/UI_and_UX/blob/main/bootstrap%20project/responsivebootstrap.html)<br>
This website showcases my ability to create a multiple column container website with a fluid 
layout design. This gives the ability to change the layout structure with different viewport size (screen size), keeping
an organized layout for users with different devices and varying screen sizes.
